PROBLEM STATEMENT:

a)	Demonstrate with an AngularJS code one way data binding and two-way data binding in AngularJS
b)	Implement a basic authentication system for a web application using AngularJS. Create a simple login page that takes a username and password, and upon submission, checks for a hardcoded set of credentials. If the credentials are valid, display a success message; otherwise, show an error message. Demonstrate AngularJS controller, module and form directives.
c)	Users want to search for books by title, author, or genre. To accomplish this, develop an AngularJS custom filter named bookFilter and include it into the application.
d)	Create a reusable and modular custom AngularJS service to handle user authentication. Include this service into an application.
